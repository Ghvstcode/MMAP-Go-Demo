The Mmap package has a `ReaderAt` struct which implements the io.ReadAt interface. The `ReaderAt` struct has an unexported field of type []byte which holds the memory-mapped file. The []byte field is unexported to ensure safety, having it publicly acessible wouldn't guarantee that it won't be overwritten. This memory-mapped file can be accessed safely by the `ReadAt` function which takes in a slice of byte and an offset. Internally, `ReadAt` copies  a sliced portion of the memory-file based on the offset to the byte slice that it was provided. Below is an excerpt of the code
